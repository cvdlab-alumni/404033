			<p>The project was developed as the final form of a course of study in Grafica Computazionale, hel by prof. A. Paoluzzi. </p>
			<p>The model has two main functions: draw_MetacarpalsFalanges(...) that draws the metacarpals and phalanges bones (as we</p>
			<p>can see in the documentation the bones are similar so they are represented with the same model) and draw_lastFalanges(...)</p>
			<p>that draws the last phalanges (that are a little different and need another model). In the end, for each finger these functions</p>
			<p>are called (receiving as parameters the length and the thick of the finger that is going to be drawn) and the objects are</p>
			<p>rotated and translated properly. Below you can find some screens made of the model. The code can be found <A HREF="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/404033/blob/master/personal%20project/personal%20project.js" TARGET="_blank">here.</A></p>
